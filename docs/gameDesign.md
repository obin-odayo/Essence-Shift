**Abstract**: in platformer puzzle games, dying means that you have to restart the level. But in this game the only way to finish a level is by making an enemy kill you so you can be that enemy.

## Introduction
Essence Shift is a 2-dimensional, puzzle and platformer game where you play as *Skelter the Skeleton* and you need to get to your *Grave*. But, it's a long and complicated way to get to your Grave so you need to special powers which you can get from other enemies. However, to get these powers you must be killed by an enemy and start the level from the very beginning. Finally, he cannot absorb alot of enemies because that would make him too *Alive* to be dead.
